This project was made with React and pure CSS.
This is a sample website for a restaurant that is called GERICHT where you can navigate through the website using the navbar links.
This project uses reusable components that can pass props to customize them and a set of containers that are sections of the webpage.
I have also used Firebase to store data in regards to a table reservation.
